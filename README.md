# bridgerton-fan-page
A website dedicated to the Bridgerton television series. 

Because I wasn't able to do this assignment as a group, I decided to try to do as many of the group leader steps as possible. I created a second github account (13ashdog13) and I added myself as a contributor to this repository. I also set up the branch protection rule like I would have if this were a group project.
